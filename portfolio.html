        <p>
            I work in the video game industry and have a passion for learning and innovating with new technologies.
            I have been creating games with <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> since 2006,
            and have experience with mobile, social, Steam, AR (augmented reality), and VR (virtual reality) games.
            I have also worked as a web developer, designing and creating cloud-based APIs and frontends for game services
            such as analytics, achievements, and leaderboards.

            Below is a mix of projects I have worked on at studios, as a contractor, independently, as a student, and at game jams.
