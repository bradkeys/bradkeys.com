            I live in Kitchener, Ontario. I enjoy making games and work in the video game industry. I have a passion
            for learning and innovating with new technologies.

            My career has primarily involved developing mobile and social games, as well as SaaS for games.
            I am most proficient with the <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity</a> game engine and help organize the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Unity-Developers/">Toronto Unity Developers meetup</a>.
            To see the projects I worked on, please check out my portfolio below.

            I use this site to showcase my projects and discuss interesting challenges I encounter as a game developer.
            Hopefully my knowledge can help other developers in their endeavours.
