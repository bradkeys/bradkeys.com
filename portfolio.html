                I live in Kitchener, Ontario. I enjoy making games and work in the video game industry. I have a passion
                for learning and innovating with new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My career has primarily involved developing mobile and social games, as well as SaaS for games.
                I am most proficient with the <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity</a> game engine and help organize the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Unity-Developers/">Toronto Unity Developers meetup</a>.
                To see the projects I worked on, please check out my portfolio below.

                I use this site to showcase my projects and discuss interesting challenges I encounter as a game developer.

			There are 100 levels, created with a proprietary level editing tool and then exported to Unity.
			The game features iOS Game Center and Google Play Game Services achievements and leaderboards.
			Players can also watch and share replays from Unity's Everyplay.
			The game also utilizes Unity ads and analytics services.

			The second major version of <a href="#Lumos">Lumos</a>. Built on a completely new tech stack to accomodate mass scaling,
			and with pricing plans to prevent having to disable popular games costing our free service
			too much money.
		</p>
		<p>
			Along with the original features of Lumos, this version includes other services
			such as Social connectivity (users, achievements, leaderboards). The entire site was built
			with enterprise in mind and is much friendlier for larger teams to work with.

			This is the first game I have designed, developed, and produced using my own game idea. It was made in 3 months
			with a team of about 5, none of whom had experience creating mobile games. It was
			created with Unity, and uses several 3rd party services such as Game Center, Lumos, and Apsalar.
		</p>
		<p>
			The gameplay is similar to that of the barrel shooting mechanic from the <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> series.
			The major differences being that time is a major element and there many forms of obstacles and puzzles to overcome.
			I'm very proud of the outcome; a fun, challenging game that looks fantastic.

			I was given a mandate to create a Facebook game using the Amazing World IP. At the time I enjoyed the crafting system
			used in <em>Castleville</em> and the hidden object gameplay in <em>Gardens of Time</em>. These elements became the focus
			of the game. I also saw a purpose for "beasties" but didn't like how companies like Zynga had implemented them (animals
			randomly appear and disable your crops/buildings until you spend energy clicking on them a few times. So another focus of
			ours was changing that mechanic into a whack-a-mole style of gameplay.
		</p>
		<p>
			 In Amazing World Friends you'll see a nice complete system that involves crafting materials collected by farming, playing hidden
			 object games, and whack-a-moling away your foes. All the while building and decorating a zany homestead for your characters.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazing-world-friends/id578737510">iPad</a> and

			This was the first Facebook game Ganz created. It went through a few very different versions before we finally released
			what you see now. As the only person on the team with previous Facebook experience, my role was mainly to keep the design
			within our technical limitations and ensure the gameplay loops encourage monetization.
		</p>
		<p>
			 TTF is a farming game, but our main focus was decorating. The artwork is extremely well done and if you take the time you
			 really can make some beautiful scenery.

			Lumos Game Analytics is a simple drag-and-drop analytics service designed specifically for Unity3D. I developed it under
			my own company with my co-founder Matthew Miner. The service is free to use.
		</p>
		<p>
			With Lumos you can record demographics, custom events, errors and debug logs, system/device information, and allow players
			to submit feedback about your game.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Lumos was rebuilt (see above) during 2013 when we began working on it full time.

			The dimeRocker platform allowed developers to create Facebook and MySpace games without learning their respective APIs.
			Instead developers only needed to know the dimeRocker API, which included
			achievements, leaderboards, inventories, wallets, and access to social hooks such as wall posts and friends lists.
			It supported Unity and Flash web games.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also developed the <em>dimeRocker Arcade</em>, an app on Facebook
			used as a game portal for Unity and Flash games. Like the initial dimeRocker, we provided
			achievements, leaderboards, and social hooks. The difference being we displayed the features on the page for you,
			greatly reducing development time needed to implement UI and logic for achievements and leaderboards. Players had a gamer
			profile that included recently played games, achievement points, and high scores. The home page worked similar to
			Kongregate, with categories such as <em>Featured, New, Popular, Hot,</em> and <em>Highest Rated</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The company changed direction in 2011, the dimeRocker platform and arcade are no longer available.

			Tire &amp; Brimstone was an online multiplayer vehicular combat game that allowed up to 6 players to compete against (shoot) each other in an arena setting.
			It was the final group project for my game design course at Vancouver Film School.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was responsible for the online networking portion of the game.
			I also created a website and backend logic that allowed us to track player statistics (kills, deaths, wins, losses, etc) and display them in game.
