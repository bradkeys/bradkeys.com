                I live in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. I enjoy creating games, work in the video game industry, and have a passion
                for learning and innovating with new technologies. My career has primarily involved developing mobile and social/web games, as well as SaaS for games.
                I'm most proficient with the <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity</a> game engine and help organize the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Unity-Developers/">Toronto Unity Developers meetup</a>.
                I use this site to showcase my projects and discuss interesting challenges I encounter as a game developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> about development questions or opportunities. I'd be glad to assist!
                You can also check out my game development company <a href="http://www.rebelhippo.com">Rebel Hippo Inc.</a> if you're
                interested in applying for a job, requesting contract Unity development from me, or if you're interested in investment opportunities.
