                This year I'll be competing against some friends in a new yearlong game competition called Play Fight 2013. The goal of the competition is to see who can make as much money as possible off indie games, while being open about the entire process. So I'll be sharing progress updates regularly on the Play Fight site, as well as my earnings, marketing strategies, and of course development decisions. The competition started January 1st so there's not much to see yet. But I have created my first post which outlines my strategy, as well as an initial prototype. I haven't heard...

                    Last month I released my first mobile game Frocket. It's an arcade style action/puzzle game where the player launches through levels using barrels to find delicious cupcakes. The full version was launched as a $0.99 game on iOS for iPhone and iPad. A couple weeks later we released a lite version for free with less content, no Game Center, and no Score Attack mode. Immediately following the release of the lite version, we released the...

                Today I experimented with Apple's Game Center for the first time and thought I'd share some pointers. I'll assume you are a registered Apple Developer and already understand how to create certificates and provisioning profiles. The first thing to know is that to use Game Center you will need to create 2 App IDs for your game on developer.apple.com. One is a wildcard App ID and the other is an explicit App ID. On iTunes Connect when you create a new App you must choose a bundle ID (wildcard App ID) and then type a suffix that matches an exclusive...

                With the release of Unity 3.5's Flash export option there are many new opportunities for Unity and Flash developers. Since my career has mainly involved working with both technologies, I wanted to try loading a Unity-exported SWF file into a Flex application to prove the possibility of a Flash game incorporating Unity content. It's straightforward to do, but the requirements aren't documented in one spot. This article should help solve that. It does not cover Flash-to-Unity communication, but it's the right place to start. Below is a short list of requirements that I'll be explaining: Flex project must use at...

                When I started using Unity in 2005 I was very attracted to programming with JavaScript. It had easier syntax and less rules for me to bother with. And Unity's documentation at the time was completely done (I think) with JavaScript examples. It just made sense to use it. I continued using JavaScript for 4 years. During that time I ran into many confusing frustrations and started to gradually strictly type my JavaScript to avoid problems. It eventually reached the point where it just made sense to switch over to C#. I can't stress enough how much of a difference this...
