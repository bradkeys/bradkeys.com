<p>
	The time and opportunity has come for me to stop working for game studios
	and begin working full-time with my own company, <a href="http://www.rebelhippo.com">Rebel Hippo Inc.</a> along with my
	swanky co-founder Matthew Miner, our company is best known for creating <a href="http://www.uselumos.com">Lumos
	Game Analytics</a> for the Unity game engine.
</p>
<p>
	We've been brewing up big plans for how we'd like to transform online services in the game industry and
	soon we'll reveal our latest and greatest product which will be of great interest
	to indie developers and small studios alike. If you're a fan of Lumos (of course
	you are!) then, yes, it is appropriate for you to be overflowing with joy right
	now. Expect similar ease-of-use but much more awesome. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p>
	This change means I've stepped down as the lead game designer of the mobile team
	at <a href="http://www.ganzstudios.com">Ganz</a>. But fear not <a href="http://frocketgame.com">Frocket</a> fans, there are some wicked ideas being tossed around
	at the studio that you and I should both look forward to. We learned quite a bit from
	developing Frocket and iterating on feedback. It's safe to say the future titles are
	sure to be barrels of fun (see what I did there?).
</p>
<p>
	Later this week I'll be moving to the Kitchener-Waterloo area to work out of our office
	at the <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/garage">VeloCity Garage</a>. It'll be cool working in that space with fellow entrepreneurial
	nerds. Aside from gaining peer knowledge on topics such as world domination, it'll be
	great to work in a place where everyone shares a passion and desire for bettering this
	tech-savvy planet we live on.
</p>
<p>
	An ongoing project Matthew and I will have in our office space is building a
	<a href="http://mamedev.org">MAME</a> arcade machine. Aside from taking the quarters from every sucker in that complex,
	it may also serve purpose as a demo machine for some of our new products coming out.
	I'll be posting more on our creation process of the machine since we're doing it from
	scratch. Legit.
</p>
<p>
	That's about it for now.
	Enjoy <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Fe2k5rf.jpg">this image</a> of video game deaths in the style of Edward
	Gorey's Gashlycrumb Tinies!

<p>
	This year I'll be competing against some friends in a new yearlong game competition called Play Fight 2013.
	The goal of the competition is to see who can make as much money as possible off indie games, while being open about the entire process.
	So I'll be sharing progress updates regularly on the <a href="http://playfight2013.com">Play Fight site</a>, as well as my earnings, marketing strategies,
	and of course development decisions.
</p>
<p>
	The competition started January 1st so there's not much to see yet. But I have created my first post which outlines
	<a href="http://playfight2013.com/2013/01/02/Kickoff/">my strategy</a>, as well as an
	<a href="http://playfight2013.com/games/clever-creatures/builds/001/">initial prototype</a>. I haven't heard much from my opponents, but I do know
	they are starting off with more ambitious projects that will likely involve server-side functionality.
</p>
<p>
	This is the competition's first year running. We envision by the end of this year we'll have pages on the site containing revenue leaderboards,
	code commit histories, and possibly even awards for milestones such as being reviewed by a well known source. We hope that by having so much
	transparency we can help other developers get a better perspective into what it means to be an indie developer, and hopefully how to be successful
	at the same time.
</p>
<p>
	For me I hope this competition will really test my limits. Although I'm starting off a little weak, the ideas I have for later this year will showcase
	complex tech with innovative game design. But I suspect what myself and everyone else involved or watching this competition will learn most are
	the deep dark and depressing secrets and strategies to marketing an indie game.
</p>
<p>
	Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/playfight2013">@PlayFight2013</a> for the latest progress and posts on the participants.
