	The time and opportunity has come for me to stop working for game studios
	and begin working full-time with my own company, <a href="http://www.rebelhippo.com">Rebel Hippo Inc.</a> along with my
	swanky co-founder Matthew Miner, our company is best known for creating <a href="http://www.uselumos.com">Lumos
	Game Analytics</a> for the Unity game engine.
</p>
<p>
	We've been brewing up big plans for how we'd like to transform online services in the game industry and
	soon we'll reveal our latest and greatest product which will be of great interest
	to indie developers and small studios alike. If you're a fan of Lumos (of course
	you are!) then, yes, it is appropriate for you to be overflowing with joy right
	now. Expect similar ease-of-use but much more awesome. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p>
	This change means I've stepped down as the lead game designer of the mobile team
	at <a href="http://www.ganzstudios.com">Ganz</a>. But fear not <a href="http://frocketgame.com">Frocket</a> fans, there are some wicked ideas being tossed around
	at the studio that you and I should both look forward to. We learned quite a bit from
	developing Frocket and iterating on feedback. It's safe to say the future titles are
	sure to be barrels of fun (see what I did there?).
</p>
<p>
	Later this week I'll be moving to the Kitchener-Waterloo area to work out of our office
	at the <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/garage">VeloCity Garage</a>. It'll be cool working in that space with fellow entrepreneurial
	nerds. Aside from gaining peer knowledge on topics such as world domination, it'll be
	great to work in a place where everyone shares a passion and desire for bettering this
	tech-savvy planet we live on.
</p>
<p>
	An ongoing project Matthew and I will have in our office space is building a
	<a href="http://mamedev.org">MAME</a> arcade machine. Aside from taking the quarters from every sucker in that complex,
	it may also serve purpose as a demo machine for some of our new products coming out.
	I'll be posting more on our creation process of the machine since we're doing it from
	scratch. Legit.
</p>
<p>
	That's about it for now.

	Gorey's Gashlycrumb Tinies!
