    For the past little while I've been helping to build the just announced service called
    <a href="http://mondocloud.com/">MondoCloud</a>.
    In a nutshell, it allows developers to do easy server-side game logic as well as real-time messaging services.
</p>
<p>
    This is a great solution for features such as in-game chat, lobby systems, and most multiplayer needs.
    The only multiplayer requirements it really wouldn't be suitable for are tracking positions in real-time.
    For example a multiplayer FPS game would not work well.
    But an RTS game could work if the mouse-click actions are sent to the other players.
</p>
<p>
    The best part about this service is that MondoCloud provides libraries for Flash and Unity so you can easily integrate it into your game.
    You can see an example of a chat system on the
    <a href="http://mondocloud.com/#5">MondoCloud website</a>.
    It demonstrates the MondoCloud messaging service in Flash, Unity, and HTML5.
</p>
<p>
    Combined with <a href="http://dimerocker.com">dimeRocker</a>,
    you really have most of your online web game needs covered.
    And it's extremely cheap compared to hiring an entire web team and running your own servers.
