    Two weekends ago I participated in <a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org/">
    Global Game Jam</a> Vancouver, a 48 hour game contest held at UBC.
    After being teamed up with some friends, we desiged a game with the intention of using the
    <a href="http://dimerocker.com">dimeRocker</a> platform I've been helping create a work.
    This meant we'd use the <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity game engine</a>
    and deploy it on Facebook.
</p>
<p>
    It was an intense 48 hours for me, being the only programmer in the group.
    But by the end of the weekend we had a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/intothedepths/">working protoype</a>
    with a few visual bugs. Our group was pleased with our work and plan on fixing it up
    to be a polished game that will take full advantage of the dimeRocker platform.

    I went to Global Game Jam last year as well.
    Both times have been an excellent experience.
    I recommend any artists, game designers or programmers check it out next year.
    It's great for testing your abilities to scope a project and work with a team under extreme time constraints.
    Both of which are challenges everyone in the game industry deals with on a regular basis.
