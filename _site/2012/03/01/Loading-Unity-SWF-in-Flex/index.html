<p>
    With the release of Unity 3.5's Flash export option there are many new
    opportunities for Unity and Flash developers. Since my career has
    mainly involved working with both technologies, I wanted to try loading a
    Unity-exported SWF file into a Flex application to prove the possibility of a Flash
    game incorporating Unity content. It's straightforward to do,
    but the requirements aren't documented in one spot. This article
    should help solve that. It does not cover Flash-to-Unity communication, but
    it's the right place to start.
    Below is a short list of requirements that I'll be explaining:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flex project must use at least
        <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4.6">
            Flex SDK 4.6
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>Flex project build should target
        <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html#fp11">
            Flash Player 11.1.0
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>Add the <em>Additional Compiler Argument</em>: -swf-version 13</li>
    <li>The flash player embed needs to include the attribute wmode=direct</li>
    <li>Your .mxml <em>application</em> tag might need to include <em>backgroundAlpha="0"</em></li>
    <li>Include the
        <a href="http://bradkeys.com/files/UnityShared.swc">
            UnityShared.swc file
        </a>
        in your project
    </li>
    <li>
        Download the files provided by Unity in this
        <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/116650-UnityShared.swc-Communicating-between-Unity-Flash-Content-and-AS3"
            target="_blank">
            forum post
        </a>
        by Unity
    </li>
</u>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Using Flex SDK 4.6</span>
    You must have at least Flex SDK version 4.6 to make sure your project has the
    neccessary Molehill and AIR APIs available. If you don't already have it,
    <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4.6">
        download it here
    </a>
    and then set your Flex SDK version by going to:
    <span class="filepath">
        Project -> Properties -> Flex Compiler -> Configure Flex SDKs -> Add...
    </span>
    Then select your downloaded 4.6 SDK folder. After selecting the folder, be sure
    to come back to select it from the list on the <em>Configure Flex SDKs</em>
    panel.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Targetting Flash Player 11</span>
    Your project must build to Flash Player 11 because it's the first Flash
    Player to support molehill's 3D rendering. You won't be able to set Flex to
    use this version until you've set your project to use SDK 4.6. You can set
    your application to target Flash Player 11 by going to:
    <span class="filepath">
        Project -> Properties -> Flex Compiler
    </span>
    Then check off <em>Require Flash Player version</em> and set it to 11.1.0.
    You will need
    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html#fp11">
        Flash Player 11
    </a>
    installed on your computer to view the 3D content.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Additional Compiler Argument</span>
    Setting the swf-version to 13 allows the Unity SWF to utilize AIR 3 APIs
    that it requires. You won't be able to do this until you have your project set
    to Flex SDK 4.6, otherwise it will throw an error. To set the swf version go to:
    <span class="filepath">
        Project -> Properties -> Flex Compiler
    </span>
    In the <em>Additional compiler arguments</em> text box be sure to include the argument
    <em>-swf-version 13</em>. You can read more about SWF versions from
    <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/airodynamics/2011/08/16/versioning-in-flash-runtime-swf-version/">
        Adobe's blog.
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Using wmode="direct"</span>
    In order for Stage 3D content to display, a Flash variable called <em>wmode</em>
    (window mode) needs to be set to equal <em>direct</em>. This requirement causes a
    Unity SWF to not open properly in a browser directly and you'll see some errors.
    The wmode attribute is set in the embed code running your Flash content.
    I set it in the following two places in my HTML and JavaScript:
</p>

<code>
    <pre>
AC_FL_RunContent(
		"wmode", "direct",
		....

if (hasRequestedVersion) {
	// if we've detected an acceptable version
	// embed the Flash Content SWF when all tests are passed
	AC_FL_RunContent(
			"wmode", "direct",
	....
    </pre>
</code>
<p>
    And lastly make sure that the HTML embed tag has the attribute
    <em>wmode="direct"</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Change the Stage Transparency</span>
    I believe there are two stages when working with molehill. There is your normal
    stage layer that we've always known and loved. And then there is the Stage
    3D layer. The Stage 3D layer is rendered behind the normal stage.
</p>
<p>
    If you load a Unity SWF into an empty stage you'll likely see a
    blank white screen. The trick is to turn the transparency of the normal
    stage to zero and it will reveal the Stage 3D content behind it. This can be
    done in your .mxml file by giving whatever <em>application</em> tag you use to
    have the attribute <em>backgroundAlpha="0"</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The cool thing about the two stages is you could create UI elements in
    Flash that overlay your Unity content. The down side is I don't believe it
    is easily possible to show Unity content above Flash content. For instance
    your game probably couldn't have a pop-up window displaying Unity content
    unless you can easily detect and hide whatever Flash objects are
    overlapping it.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Include the UnityShared SWC file</span>
    To load and communicate with the Unity SWF you're going to need to include
    a SWC file called <em>UnityShared.swc</em> in your project. This file is
    created when you export a SWF from Unity. For convenience you can also
    <a href="/files/UnityShared.swc">
        download
    </a>
    it from me. After moving the file into your project go to:
    <span class="filepath">
        Project -> Properties -> Flex Build Path
    </span>
    Click <em>Add SWC...</em> and select UnityShared.swc. This SWC file contains
    a few classes made by Unity. The class we care about is
    <em>UnityContentLoader</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Loading Unity Content</span>
    To load the Unity content you're going to need to look at this
    <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/116650-UnityShared.swc-Communicating-between-Unity-Flash-Content-and-AS3">
        forum post
    </a>
    provided by Unity and at least download the file entitled
    <em>"AS3Communication_as3_src.zip"</em>. Add the two ActionScript files to
    your Flex project as well as the images. You will probably want to edit the
    file called SimplePreloader.as and change the line that says:
</p>
<code>
    <pre>
unityContentLoader = new UnityContentLoader("unity-flash-small.swf", this, params, false);
    </pre>
</code>
<p>
    You want the string <em>"unity-flash-small.swf"</em> to be the name and path of the
    Unity SWF you want to load. You might even want to change this class to accept
    a string URL for the file you are loading to make it more reusable. This class
    can load in remote Unity SWFs from web servers, or it can load local files. Once you
    have this part set up the way you want, you can get things rocking and rolling
    with the following code wherever you want to load the Unity SWF in your project.
</p>
<code>
    <pre>
import com.unity.UnityContentLoader;

private var unityContentLoader:UnityContentLoader;

private function startLoad() : void {
	var loader:SimplePreloader = new SimplePreloader();
	stage.addChild(loader);
}
    </pre>
</code>
<p>
   This should be all you really need to get started with loading in Unity content
   to a Flash application. If you want to know about communicating with the loaded
   Unity content I recommend continuing to read this
   <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/116650-UnityShared.swc-Communicating-between-Unity-Flash-Content-and-AS3">
       forum topic
   </a>
   . To export a SWF file from Unity, read
   <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/publishing/flash">
       this page
   </a>
   on their website.
