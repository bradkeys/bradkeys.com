                One of the easiest and most effective ways for people to hack a game is byte editing. Basically there are tools available that can pin-point variables used in your game and change their values. For example if you have a game that gives the player a score, the player can use a tool to search for that value in their system's memory and modify it to be whatever they want. This can be particularly bad if your game then submits the score to a database shared with other players or rewards the player based on their score. Below is an...

                    I've been inspired to write this article with the recent announcement of the dimeRocker Arcade. It's a very exciting announcement and I'll explain why by comparing it to the current dimeRocker platform that was released this past March. About the dimeRocker (dR) Platform The main purpose of dR is to simplify the social game development process and help developers make money. It's currently targeted at Unity developers. It takes care of most server-related features a...

                    For the past little while I've been helping to build the just announced service called MondoCloud. In a nutshell, it allows developers to do easy server-side game logic as well as real-time messaging services. This is a great solution for features such as in-game chat, lobby systems, and most multiplayer needs. The only multiplayer requirements it really wouldn't be suitable for are tracking positions in real-time. For example a multiplayer FPS game would not work...

                For the past few months I've been slowly transforming this site into a development blog. Articles can be linked to individually, the main feed is now paginated, and most recently I added an RSS Feed. From now on I'll be posting about my game design and programming experiences and opinions. My current job has put me through a lot of challenges with Unity3D, Flash, and other technologies like PHP, JavaScript, databases, and Unix based operations. All of which have been in some shape or form tied into making social games for Facebook and other social networks. I have a unique...

I met hundreds of developers and gave hands-on lessons about the dimeRocker platform, as well as two presentations in the Unity booth. If you'd like to check out the two games we demoed, here are links for BATTLE BEARS and Air Traffic Commander. Both utilize features such as leaderboards, profile info, friend info, storing data, wall posts, and...
