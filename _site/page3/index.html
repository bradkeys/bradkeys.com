<p>
	Last month I released my first mobile game <a href="http://wwww.frocketgame.com">Frocket</a>.
	It's an arcade style action/puzzle game where the player launches through levels using barrels to find delicious cupcakes.
	The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/frocket/id561291205">full version</a> was launched as a $0.99 game on iOS for iPhone and iPad. A couple weeks later
	we released a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/frocket-lite/id583081287">lite version</a> for free with less content, no Game Center,
	and no Score Attack mode. Immediately following the release of the lite version, we released the full version on
	<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/frocketgame/frocket">Kongregate</a> for free as a way to promote the full version on iOS. I'm currently working
	on an Android version and later potentially versions for the Mac App Store and Chrome store.
</p>

<p>
	I was the sole programmer on the project, which was excellent for learning. The game was created using the Unity game engine, which
	when combined with certain Unity plugins allowed me to entirely bypass needing to learn Objective-C or much of how Xcode works.
	If you've ever considered making an iOS game but you were deterred because you don't know Objective-C, I highly recommend the Unity approach.
	Developing the game for different platforms was also very simple thanks to Unity. The web port took about a day just to ensure no iOS code was
	running and to implement ads promoting the iOS version. The Android version has taken a little longer so I could make sure we support a wider
	range of screen resolutions. All-in-all though it's been a fairly straightforward process. And now that it's done I'm very confident I could do it
	all again much faster. Here's a list of plugins used on the project and what they did for the game:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://u3d.as/content/prime31/i-os-etcetera-plugin/2CU">iOS Etcetera Plugin by Prime[31]</a> Request to rate app, Push notifications</li>
		<li><a href="http://u3d.as/content/prime31/i-os-store-kit-in-app-purchase-plugin/2Nu">iOS StoreKit Plugin by Prime[31]</a> Simple in-app purchases</li>
		<li><a href="http://u3d.as/content/chris-west/mega-fiers/1Qa">Megafiers by Chris West</a> Allowed us to easily animate water and foliage</li>
		<li><a href="http://u3d.as/content/rebel-hippo/lumos-game-analytics/2pc">Lumos by Rebel Hippo</a> Used for analytics tracking/reporting</li>
		<li><a href="http://apsalar.com/blog/2012/10/ios-unity-plugin-now-available-for-download/">Apsalar by Apsalar Inc.</a> Used for analytics tracking/reporting</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	It took about 3 months to create the game with a team that was usually 5 people during development. It's the first "indie" game development approach by Ganz,
	and it really worked out well. We were able to create <em>a lot</em> in a very short amount of time, and we think it looks terrific and plays quite well. The first
	month was spent creating a prototype, character and environment concepts, and the game framework. The second month was spent creating art assets, levels, UI,
	and integrating the plugins mentioned above. The last month was spent on levels, audio, performance optimizations, testing, polish, creating the website, and some ads
	for marketing. The game took about a week to be approved by Apple. Now we're working on additional content, bug fixing, and ports.
</p>
<p>
	The core learnings I've taken from this project are how to develop for iOS (Xcode) and Android (Android Developer Tools), mobile optimization techniques and constraints
	(lighting, audio, code, art, dynamic/static batching, etc), and of course marketing. Being the guinea pig game for our new mobile effort at Ganz, we've been able to experiment
	with basically whatever means we want just to see how it affects sales. All I'm going to say is there's a reason you can find so many articles online about the mysteries of being
	successful on the app store. There are a ton of tools available out there, but here's what I believe your ultimate goal should be. It sounds obvious, but you want as many good
	ratings as possible. Every marketing effort you do should be to push that number up. Doing so will greatly increase your visibility on countless charts within and outside the App Store.
	As a developer this means your logic in <em>when</em> you should prompt the player to rate your game needs to be absolutely solid. Really think it through for every release on every platform.
</p>
<p>
	And lastly I'll leave with a couple tips to get download spikes. As I just mentioned above, many high ratings are what will get you on charts. But there are also a ton of sites our there tracking
	new games, includes updates. When your game first releases, if you're a fairly unknown developer or publisher, don't expect anything too exciting to happen. After some basic
	marketing and getting your friends to buy/download the game, if you did your rating logic properly then hopefully you'll get a decent amount (10+) before you are ready for an update.
	This is when it will get more exciting. Releasing an update will make your game appear on many, many sites but this time people will see the ratings and start paying attention to it.
	At least this is what I gather from my experience so far. Another tip you can try after getting some ratings is to make your game free for a day or two. Again, it will appear on sites
	tracking games that have dropped in price and with a decent amount of good ratings, people will take interest.
</p>
<p>
	The post-launch experience of a mobile game has been just as exciting as creating it, and I look forward to the knowledge I'll gain while Frocket runs its course. Enjoy!

  <h1><a href="/2012/09/10/Using-Game-Center-with-Unity-iOS/">Using Game Center with Unity iOS</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="date">2012-09-10 00:00:00 -0400</span>
  </p>
  <div class="content">
    <img class="post-img" src="/img/posts/unity-ios.png" />
<p>
    Today I experimented with Apple's Game Center for the first time and thought I'd share some pointers.
    I'll assume you are a registered Apple Developer and already understand how to create certificates and provisioning profiles.
</p>
<p>
    The first thing to know is that to use Game Center you will need to create 2 App IDs for your game on
    <a href="http://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a>.
    One is a wildcard App ID and the other is an explicit App ID.
    On <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com">iTunes Connect</a>
    when you create a new App you must choose a bundle ID (wildcard App ID) and then type a suffix that matches an exclusive App ID you have created.
</p>
<p>
    For this example lets pretend my team is called <em>Awesome</em>, my certificate is for <em>Brad</em> on team awesome, and my provisioning profile is for team <em>Awesome</em>.
    Team Awesome's ID is <strong>ABCDE12345</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Creating App IDs</span>Read Apple's Explanation
    <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1713/_index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a> and create a new App ID.
    The description can be whatever you want.
    The prefix for your App ID is generated by Apple.
    I chose to use my team ID.
    Whatever team you are part of in your provisioning profile should match this prefix.
    You can ensure this by choosing <em>Use Team ID</em> when creating the App ID.
    This means my prefix will be ABCDE12345.
</p>
<p>
    The bundle identifier is what determines if this App ID is wildcard or explicit.
    You'll need one of each to use Game Center.
    Lets create the wildcard App ID first; in this example it will be <em>com.bradkeys.*</em>
    Click submit and look at your list.
    Mine would look like <strong>ABCDE12345.com.bradkeys.*</strong>
    You'll see that your newly created App ID does not support Game Center and there's no way to enable it.
    That's ok!
</p>
<p>
    Now to create a second App ID.
    Again choose a description, then use your team ID.
    Now for the bundle identifier use the same as your wildcard App ID but actually use a specific suffix.
    For this example I'll type <em>com.bradkeys.myGame</em>
    Click submit, check out your lovely list (mine looks like <strong>ABCDE12345.com.bradkeys.myGame</strong>) and bam you can see this one is good to go for Game Center (green lights).
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Game Center Provisioning Profile</span>
    You only need a provisioning profile from your explicit App ID.
    Go to provisioning in <a href="http://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a>, create a new one.
    Select your certificate, select your explicit App ID, and select the devices you want to test on.
    Finish and download the provisioning profile to your device(s) via Xcode.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Creating a Game Center App on iTunes Connect</span>
    Go to <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com">iTunes Connect</a> and choose to manage your apps.
    Create a new app and choose iOS. Your name and SKU can be whatever you like.
    Under Bundle ID, choose the wildcard App ID you just created.
    A suffix field now appears and here you finish the Bundle ID using the end of your explicit App ID.
    In this example I would select my <em>com.bradkeys.*</em> bundle and then type <em>myGame</em> inside the suffix field.
    The rest of the setup is straightforward.
    Once your new app and version are created, go to the Game Center link and create an achievement (also fairly straightforward to do).
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Unity Player Settings</span>
    In Unity go to your iOS Player settings <em>(Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> iOS)</em>
    and in <em>other settings</em> make sure your bundle ID matches the bundle ID of your app in iTunes Connect.
    In my example it would be <strong>com.bradkeys.myGame</strong> (notice I didn't include my team ID).
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Using Unity's Social API</span>
    Although their documentation is pretty shotty right now, they do provide a complete example
    <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/net-SocialAPI.html">here</a> that you can essentially copy and paste into your code and try.
    Do that.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="subtitle">Using Game Center in Sandbox Mode</span>
    The last trick is to make sure you log out of Game Center on your mobile device.
    Open the Game Center app, on the main screen click your account and then choose to sign out.
    Close the Game Center app.
    Build and run your game from Unity.
</p>
<p>
    Once your game is running on your device and it runs your script containing Unity's social API, it will attempt to log you into Game Center.
    Choose to sign in using an Apple Developer account (not sure if that's required, but that's what I did).
    If your credentials are wrong, it will say <em>This game is not supported by Game Center</em>.
    Which isn't true!
    Just restart your app and make sure you get your username and password right.
</p>
<p>
    If you're not prompted to sign in with an account.. I did notice that on my iPad I had to sign in using the Game Center app itself and it said <em>SandBox</em> right there.
    After I signed in, I went back to my app and it worked correctly.
</p>
<p>
    Once you are signed in a banner appears along the top alerting you that you have signed in and that you are in sandbox mode.
    If it doesn't say sandbox mode then you have done something wrong.
    But hopefully it does say it and from there and you can follow <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Social.html">Unity's social API documentation</a> to do whatever you fancy.
    Enjoy!
</p>
