                    <p>When I started using Unity in 2005 I was very attracted to programming with JavaScript. It had easier syntax and less rules for me to bother with. And Unity's documentation at the time was completely done (I think) with JavaScript examples. It just made sense to use it. I continued using JavaScript for 4 years. During that time I ran into many confusing frustrations and started to gradually strictly type my JavaScript to avoid problems....</p>

So if you'd like to meet up at some point, whether it be to discuss Lumos or just to grab a drink or two, just give one of us a shout. We had a lot of awesome developments over the summer while...</p>

                    <p>Last week the game analytics service I have been helping with, Lumos, won an entrepreneurial competition held by the University of Waterloo (UW). We received a whopping $25 000 from UW's startup incubator called Velocity. Thanks to this funding there will be a lot more development time put towards Lumos in the coming months, and that is very exciting indeed. You can read all about it here. While we're on the topic of exciting things,...</p>

                    <p>For the last half year I've been working with a team on a new service that's launching today called Lumos (www.uselumos.com). Lumos provides game developers with an extremely useful analytics system that is very simple to use. In fact, it's almost entirely automated. At the moment we completely support the Unity game engine, with support for other engines currently in the works. Oddly enough there really doesn't seem to be any decent analytics services available...</p>

A decision made because I was ready for something new and wanted to return to my home province of Ontario. My experience with dimeRocker was incredibly valuable.
