                Last week the game analytics service I have been helping with, Lumos, won an entrepreneurial competition held by the University of Waterloo (UW). We received a whopping $25 000 from UW's startup incubator called Velocity. Thanks to this funding there will be a lot more development time put towards Lumos in the coming months, and that is very exciting indeed. You can read all about it here. While we're on the topic of exciting things, earlier today I made a video tutorial on how to get started with Lumos. Not only is it short, simple, and informative, but you also...

                For the last half year I've been working with a team on a new service that's launching today called Lumos (www.uselumos.com). Lumos provides game developers with an extremely useful analytics system that is very simple to use. In fact, it's almost entirely automated. At the moment we completely support the Unity game engine, with support for other engines currently in the works. Oddly enough there really doesn't seem to be any decent analytics services available for game developers at the moment. So I encourage you to check it out and give your input on the website or contact me directly....

                This is a bit overdue. I left OverInteractive Media Inc. (OMI), the creators of dimeRocker, at the end of February this year. A decision made because I was ready for something new and wanted to return to my home province of Ontario. My experience with dimeRocker was incredibly valuable. I came on as the 3rd employee (they are now much bigger) and was expected to be able to do everything, even though I was hired as a Unity developer. I had to jump into software architecture design, server-side and front-end programming, and eventually Unity and Flash AS3 development. It was...

                I created a complete play-through video of Hip Ship for those interested in seeing all of the content in its current state. You can view it below. As far as future development goes, after looking at statistics and getting feedback I think it would be best if I changed the main focus of the game. I want to allow the player to play each level individually and rank them based on how well they do with time, coins collected, and how many tries it took them. This would give players a more casual experience where they can go at their...

                This is extremely simple to do but may not be obvious at first. For my purposes I wanted a clickable label that opened my website. To do this you need to create a button and change it's GUIStyle to use your label's GUIStyle. Then use Unity's Application.OpenURL function to actually open a web page. if (GUILayout.Button("\nCreated by\nwww.bradkeys.com", GUI.skin.label)) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application.OpenURL("http://bradkeys.com/"); } This works great in most cases but my Facebook app used an iFrame to display its content. When I used Application.OpenURL it loaded my website inside of Facebook and looked awful. Thankfully Unity can execute custom JavaScript from the...
