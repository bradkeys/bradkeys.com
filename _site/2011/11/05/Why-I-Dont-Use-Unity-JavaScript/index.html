    <p>
    When I started using Unity in 2005 I was very attracted to programming with JavaScript.
    It had easier syntax and less rules for me to bother with.
    And Unity's documentation at the time was completely done (I think) with JavaScript examples.
    It just made sense to use it.
</p>
<p>
    I continued using JavaScript for 4 years.
    During that time I ran into many confusing frustrations and started to gradually strictly type my JavaScript to avoid problems.
    It eventually reached the point where it just made sense to switch over to C#.
    I can't stress enough how much of a difference this has made in my coding experience with Unity.
    Here's why...
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Compiler Confusion</strong>
    <br />
    There's quite a bit you can get away with using Unity JS.
    So much in fact that you might actually have many errors in your code, but they only occur during run-time.
    This mostly happens when an untyped variable is assigned to a typed variable.
    For example
</p>
<code>
<pre>
var aVector;
var anInt : int;

function Start() {
	aVector = Vector3.zero;
	anInt = aVector;
}
</pre>
</code>
<p>
    This code compiles just fine, but as soon as it's executed during run-time an error will occur.
    A pretty easy fix as soon as the error pops up.
    But that's just it.
    What if you never hit the case where the error occurs?
    You end up releasing your game with a bug just waiting to happen.
    And it probably will.
    Strictly typing your code or using C# will avoid this issue.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IDE Confusion</strong>
    <br />
    This is more of a convenience frustration.
    If you're using an IDE like MonoDevelop and you're programming with untyped elements of your code, then your IDE won't be able to use some of its convenient features.
    Looking at the code example above, your IDE would not know to list Vector methods when dealing with variable <em>aVector</em>.
    Strictly typing your code or using C# will avoid this issue.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Improved Run-Time Performance</strong>
    <br />
    You may not ever notice it, but strictly typing your code or using C# will actually
    <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/index.Performance_Optimization.html">make your game faster</a>
    during run-time. Cool!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Benefits of C#</strong>
    <br />
    Some major benefits of using C# (not strictly typed JS) is that it's a completely
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh341490">documented language</a>.
    If you ever want to know how to do something, just look it up.
    JavaScript doesn't have official documentation and Unity's implementation of JavaScript is not the same as the JavaScript known to the web.
    So it can be annoying just to look up even the simplest thing.
    In fact some times you'll need to look up C# syntax to figure out the correct syntax for Unity's JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    Using JavaScript will restrict you from using some libraries that C# will be able to use.
    But C# can use all the libraries JS has access to.
    For example C# can access the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINQ">LINQ</a>
    libraries but Unity JavaScript cannot.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Compiler Confusion Continued</strong>
    <br />
    There are areas of the Unity API where both JavaScript <em>and</em>
    C# users are led into avoidable issues with the compiler missing errors.
    A big culprit being the <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html">GetComponent function</a>.
    One way of using it is by passing a string for the name of a component, rather than a type.
    This caused me major headaches.
    I used to love it because I could simply type in a string of the component I wanted and <em>BAM</em> it worked.
    Really awesome; until you make a typo that's not obvious at all and the compiler isn't pointing it out.
    Here's an example of just how much you can get away with without the compiler throwing an error.
    In the example below the component and its variable do not exist, but Unity is totally cool with it during compilation.
</p>
<code>
<pre>
var c : int  = GetComponent("Something I Just Made Up").someVariable;
</pre>
</code>
<p>
    If you're cautious with your decisions and ensure the compiler can catch as many problems as possible,
    your development process is going to go much smoother.
