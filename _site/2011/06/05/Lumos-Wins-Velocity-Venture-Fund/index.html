    Last week the game analytics service I have been helping with,
    <a href="http://www.uselumos.com">Lumos</a>, won an entrepreneurial competition
    held by the University of Waterloo (UW).
    We received a whopping $25 000 from UW's startup incubator called
    <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/">Velocity</a>.
    Thanks to this funding there will be a lot more development time put towards Lumos
    in the coming months, and that is very exciting indeed.
    You can <a href="http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/events/velocity-venture-fund-finals">read all about it here</a>.

    While we're on the topic of exciting things, earlier today I made a video tutorial on how to get started with Lumos.
    Not only is it short, simple, and informative, but you also get to listen to my manly voice.
    Oh yes, after all that hype you bet I'll embed it right here for your viewing enjoyment.
    You're welcome.

    I appreciate any feedback from developers on Lumos and what you would like to get from it in the future.
    If you have any questions, always feel free to ask me.
