    I started working at <a href="http://www.overinteractive.com/">OverInteractive Media</a>
    working on <a href="http://www.dimerocker.com/">dimeRocker</a>, a service for putting your
    <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> games on social networking websites,
    along with some other useful tools.
    This has sparked an interest for me to start developing small games for Facebook in my free time.
</p>
<p>
    Here's what I've currently got in the works:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Metropolis</strong> -
        Live amongst your friends in a 3D MMO city where you build up your social status.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mad Lab</strong> -
        Single player puzzle game based off the card game
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-nine_(addition_card_game)">Ninety-Nine</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Untitled</strong> -
        Resource management game aimed at educating young students in environmental problems.
    </li>
</ul>

    And here are some pictures of past projects I'll be writing about soon:
