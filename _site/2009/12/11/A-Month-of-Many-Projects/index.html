    I've been busy at work continuing the development of the dimeRocker platform.
    The projects I mentioned in my previous post are progressing well.
    I've decided however that this month I'll focus less on larger projects and instead create small games that may only take about a weekend to do.

    So far I have three games in mind:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Mad Lab</em>
        which I mentioned last blog post
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Untitled Train Puzzle Game</em>
        designed by a couple friends of mine
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>The Crystal Conquest</em>
        remake in Unity (currently Flash)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    My goal is to get at least 2/3 of these games created by start of the new year.
