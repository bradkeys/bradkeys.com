                    Intro This past weekend I once again collaborated with the talented Brent Mitchell for the 48 hour Global Game Jam. The theme this year was Waves. This jam was quite different than our past collaborations because we worked remotely from each other. We then decided to make it more difficult for ourselves by making a virtual reality game, which only Brent has the hardware (HTC Vive) for currently. And to top it off we also...

                    I recently participated in the Toronto Global Game Jam. On my team was the talented Brent Mitchell (level design, programming) and Mark Tome (artist). The theme this year was What do we do now?. Brent and I spent Friday evening having a few pints at a nearby pub and brainstorming many game ideas. Most ideas focussed on Oculus Rift, since we thought it would be fun to develop for. All our ideas were multiplayer since...

We've been brewing up big plans for how we'd like to transform online services in the game industry and soon we'll reveal our latest and greatest product which will be of great interest to indie developers and small studios alike.

                This year I'll be competing against some friends in a new yearlong game competition called Play Fight 2013. The goal of the competition is to see who can make as much money as possible off indie games, while being open about the entire process. So I'll be sharing progress updates regularly on the Play Fight site, as well as my earnings, marketing strategies, and of course development decisions. The competition started January 1st so there's not much to see yet. But I have created my first post which outlines my strategy, as well as an initial prototype. I haven't heard...
