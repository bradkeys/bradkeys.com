    Last week I was in San Francisco with <a href="http://overinteractivemedia.com">OMI</a>
    to help man the <a href="http://dimerocker.com">dimeRocker</a> booth at
    <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">GDC</a>.
    I met hundreds of developers and gave hands-on lessons about the dimeRocker platform,
    as well as two presentations in the Unity booth.

    If you'd like to check out the two games we demoed, here are links for
    <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/battlebearsgame/">BATTLE BEARS</a> and
    <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/airtrafficcommander/">Air Traffic Commander</a>.
    Both utilize features such as leaderboards, profile info, friend info, storing data, wall posts, and micro-transactions.
    At GDC we showed both these games running on MySpace and Facebook without the need to make different versions of the games.
