    Today I launched Hip Ship, a game I've been developing over the past few weekends.
    It's a short but challenging arcade style game where you navigate a spaceship through several mazes.
    You have to avoid walls and objects while beating each maze in the shortest time possible.
    You can optionally collect coins to slightly improve your score.
</p>

<p>
    I chose to use the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/dimerocker/">dimeRocker Arcade app</a>
    on Facebook [disclaimer: I work on dimeRocker] as my deployment platform using the
    <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity game engine</a>.
    The Arcade allowed me to easily integrate high scores, achievements and social features, as well as benefit from the traffic being sent to that app.
</p>
<p>
    The game was originally a single level demo I made at work.
    I had four hours to create a game from scratch that would showcase the features used in the dimeRocker Arcade.
    So I decided the best way to end off with a decent looking project in such a short amount of time was to start by using one of the Unity tutorials and modify it into a simple game.
    The tutorial I chose was the <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/resources/tutorials/2d-gameplay-tutorial">2D Gameplay Tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>
    After playing around with the tutorial the thing I enjoyed most about it were the controls for flying the ship.
    I was then inspired to make a game out of the platforms and kill zones.
    This was fairly straightforward since the platform objects were setup nicely.
    I designed a level on-the-fly, created a spawn point, a finish point, and a timer.
    The score was originally based on how long it took you to beat the level.
    However I didn't find it very interesting if time was the only factor.
    So I added in the coin collecting to increase your score.
    I whipped up some achievements using dimeRocker based on how many coins you could collect.
    And that was the demo!
</p>
<p>
    After seeing it get a decent amount of plays in the Arcade I decided to transform Hip Ship into a multi-level game.
    The largest challenge here was redoing the score system in a way that made sense over multiple levels.
    Considering the levels were already particularly challenging, I decided to add lives into the game.
    And instead of playing one level at a time, I went with the true spirit of an arcade game and had it be continuous throughout a single play.
    Since the levels were quite frustrating, I decided to award players with an extra life each time they complete a level.
    At the end of the game if you finish, you are awarded bonus points for the remaining lives you have.
</p>
<p>
    Now that all is said and done I hope this game becomes a short competitive play experience among casual gamers on Facebook.
    And it's great that I was able to do it using completely free tools and assets.
