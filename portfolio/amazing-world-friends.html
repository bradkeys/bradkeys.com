title: Amazing World Friends

<p>
	I was given a mandate to create a Facebook game using the Amazing World IP. At the time I enjoyed the crafting system
	used in <em>Castleville</em> and the hidden object gameplay in <em>Gardens of Time</em>. These elements became the focus
	of the game. I also saw a purpose for "beasties" but didn't like how companies like Zynga had implemented them (animals
	randomly appear and disable your crops/buildings until you spend energy clicking on them a few times. So another focus of
	ours was changing that mechanic into a whack-a-mole style of gameplay.

<p>
	 In Amazing World Friends you'll see a nice complete system that involves crafting materials collected by farming, playing hidden
	 object games, and whack-a-moling away your foes. All the while building and decorating a zany homestead for your characters.
