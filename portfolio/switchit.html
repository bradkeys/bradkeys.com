	This game was created in 48 hours by
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentgmitchell/">Brent Mitchell</a>
	and I during the 2015 Global Game Jam in Toronto, ON.
	The theme, which dictated the design, was <em>"What do we do now?"</em>.
</p>
<p>
    We decided it would be fun to make a head-to-head multiplayer game with several game modes, one is randomly selected, but the players have to figure out what it is.
    This meant we'd need to create a good variety of game modes in order to make it challenging.
    The modes we managed to squeeze into the timeframe were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Deathmatch</strong> - Players have health and run around shooting each other</li>
    <li><strong>Capture the Flag</strong> - Bring one flag to another. You cannot shoot while carrying the flag.</li>
    <li><strong>Oddball</strong> - Find the oddball, disguised as a flag amongst other fakes. Carry it for X time, cannot shoot while carrying.</li>
    <li><strong>Collect the Dots</strong> - Throughout the level are dots you can pickup, get more than your opponent.</li>
    <li><strong>Break Stuff</strong> - Drop bombs to break objects, one is hiding treasure!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    After a player wins the round, a new round begins with a new random game mode.
    The first player to win 3 rounds wins the game.
</p>
<p>
    My role on the project was programming the game modes and core framework of the game, along with the UI.
    It was the first time I used Unity's own non-programmatable GUI system, which I have used ever since.
</p>
<p>
    The game is played with a game controller of your choosing and must be played by 2 people.
    Windows only.
