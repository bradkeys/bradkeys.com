<p>
	The second major version of Lumos. Built on a completely new tech stack to accomodate mass scaling,
	and with pricing plans to prevent having to disable popular games costing our free service
	too much money.
</p>
<p>
	Along with the original features of Lumos, this version includes other services
	such as Social connectivity (users, achievements, leaderboards). The entire site was built
	with enterprise in mind and is much friendlier for larger teams to work with.
