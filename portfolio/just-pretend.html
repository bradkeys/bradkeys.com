title: Just Pretend
---

<p>
    I designed this game with inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past">Zelda: A Link to the Past</a>
    but as a roguelike with multiple endings similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelunky">Spelunky</a>.
    You can read more about the game <a href="http://rebelhippo.com/products/just-pretend/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    My roles on the project are Game Designer, Lead Programmer, Producer, and Web Developer.
    As the head of the studio I also take on several other roles such as accounting and marketing.
</p>

    I created a concept/pitch document for the game and used it to apply to the <a href="http://www.cmf-fmc.ca/programs-deadlines/programs/innovation-program">Canada Media Fund (CMF)</a> to cover the majority of the prototype costs.
    Upon receiving funding I hired two 3D artists, a concept artist, and a sound designer to create assets.
    I created a grid-based editor tool in Unity which helped create dynamic random content in a similar fashion as Spelunky.
    I also notably programmed the procedural world creation and enemy AI logic.
    As the prototype came together I created a website and blog for <a href="http://rebelhippo.com">Rebel Hippo</a> to showcase the game and its development.

<p>
    It was featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVSrbZI_XXE">Canada reel at GDC 2016</a>, which I attended to show off the prototype to the press.
    Currently the game is in limbo as we await additional funding for the production phase of the game.
    A virtual reality spin-off has also been designed.
