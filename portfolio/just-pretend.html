<p>
	This project is currently in development.
    The idea started in 2015 when I regularly played the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelunky">Spelunky</a>
    and had just recently finished yet another play through of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past">Zelda: A Link to the Past</a>.
    Both games I hold in high regard, and like all games you fall in love with, there are certain things you just wish could be better.
    In this case I felt so strong about it that I wanted to do something about it!
    The idea was to create a game like Zelda, but as a roguelike with multiple endings, like Spelunky.
</p>
<p>
    My roles on the project are Game Designer, Lead Programmer, Producer, and Web Developer.
    As the head of the studio I also take on several other roles such as accounting and marketing.
</p>

    The game concept was designed in early 2015.
    The game can take 30-60 minutes to complete if you're an expert, but will take many failed attempts to accomplish.
    However there are many different ways to beat the game, so exploration is key.
    The gameplay itself is similar to Zelda; combat, items, design.
    The world is procedurally generated each time you play, and there is no saving.
    If you die, you restart from scratch.
</p>
<p>
    The game is intended to be played by up to 4 players co-operatively using game controllers on current generation consoles.
</p>
<p>
    A prototype was created from 2015-2016 with a team which included two 3D artists, a concept artist, and a sound designer.
    It features combat with a few weapons, several different enemies, and 4 environments.
    The world is procedurally generated and features several original soundtracks.
</p>
<p>
    Pending additional funding, the game will be in production throughout 2017/2018.
