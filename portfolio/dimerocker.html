<p>
	The dimeRocker platform allowed developers to create Facebook and MySpace games without learning their respective APIs.
	Instead developers only needed to know the dimeRocker API, which included
	achievements, leaderboards, inventories, wallets, and access to social hooks such as wall posts and friends lists.
	It supported Unity and Flash web games.

<p>
	We also developed the <em>dimeRocker Arcade</em>, an app on Facebook
	used as a game portal for Unity and Flash games. Like the initial dimeRocker, we provided
	achievements, leaderboards, and social hooks. The difference being we displayed the features on the page for you,
	greatly reducing development time needed to implement UI and logic for achievements and leaderboards. Players had a gamer
	profile that included recently played games, achievement points, and high scores. The home page worked similar to
	Kongregate, with categories such as <em>Featured, New, Popular, Hot,</em> and <em>Highest Rated</em>.

	The company changed direction in 2011, the dimeRocker platform and arcade are no longer available.
