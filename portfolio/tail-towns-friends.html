<p>
	This was the first Facebook game Ganz created. It went through a few very different versions before we finally released
	what you see now. As the only person on the team with previous Facebook experience, my role was mainly to keep the design
	within our technical limitations and ensure the gameplay loops encourage monetization.

	 TTF is a farming game, but our main focus was decorating. The artwork is extremely well done and if you take the time you
	 really can make some beautiful scenery.
