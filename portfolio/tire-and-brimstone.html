title: Tire &amp; Brimstone
---

<p>
	Tire &amp; Brimstone was an online multiplayer vehicular combat game that allowed up to 6 players to compete against (shoot) each other in an arena setting.
	It was the final group project for my game design course at Vancouver Film School.

	I was responsible for the online networking portion of the game.
	I also created a website and backend logic that allowed us to track player statistics (kills, deaths, wins, losses, etc) and display them in game.
