<p>
	This is the first game I have designed, developed, and produced using my own game idea. It was made in 3 months
	with a team of about 5, none of whom had experience creating mobile games. It was
	created with Unity, and uses several 3rd party services such as Game Center, Lumos, and Apsalar.

	The gameplay is similar to that of the barrel shooting mechanic from the <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> series.
	The major differences being that time is a major element and there many forms of obstacles and puzzles to overcome.
	I'm very proud of the outcome; a fun, challenging game that looks fantastic.
