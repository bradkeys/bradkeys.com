title: Bursting with Colour

<p>
	This game was created in 48 hours by
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brentgmitchell/">Brent Mitchell</a>,
	<a href="http://www.matthewminer.com">Matthew Miner</a>,
	and I during the 2014 Global Game Jam in Waterloo, ON.
	The theme, which dictated the game design, was "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are".</em>

    We enjoyed co-operative games, so we headed in that direction.
    After a game design pow-wow, we decided on the idea of a platformer where there are 4 colours of blocks, but only 2 may be active at once, each controlled by a player.
    We mapped each colour to a button on a game controller, so for instance, the A-button activates the colour green.
    Each player starts with one randomly active colour already in use.
    When you activate a new colour, your previous colour becomes inactive.
    This requires players to communicate very well with each other since one player may deactivate a colour while the other is jumping to that block.
    The screen gradually moves upwards, and players receive a score based on how high they can get.
    The level is procedurally generated.
    It's a very tough but hilarious game!

    This was our first time using Unity's 2D mode.
    It was also our first time using a particular library allowing us to utilize Xbox 360 controllers.
    I was primarily responsible for the character controls, input, scoring, and procedural level generation.
