<p>
	Lumos Game Analytics is a simple drag-and-drop analytics service designed specifically for Unity3D. I developed it under
	my own company with my co-founder Matthew Miner. The service is free to use.
</p>
<p>
	With Lumos you can record demographics, custom events, errors and debug logs, system/device information, and allow players
	to submit feedback about your game.

    Lumos was rebuilt (see above) during 2013 when we began working on it full time.
