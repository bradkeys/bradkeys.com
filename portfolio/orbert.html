title: Orbert

<p>
    Orbert was originally created by <a href="http://www.matthewminer.com">Matthew Miner</a> and I in 2013 while we were looking for contract work.
    Matthew designed and programmed the game and I designed and created many of the levels.
    It was released for Android on Google Play in Canada during Spring 2013.
    Players had the first 10 levels unlocked for free, while the rest had to be purchased.
</p>
<p>
    The game features 100 levels, ranging from easy difficulty to extremely challenging.
    It's a one-button game where the player taps and holds to orbit around a moon, and releases the tap to send Orbert flying.
    The timing of the player's tapping is very important as it dictactes movement direction and speed.
</p>
<p>
    Orbert received great positive feedback amongst our friends and family.
    To our amazement, a decent amount of players actually beat all 100 levels, some of which seem almost impossible to complete!
    This praise led me to revisit Orbert in 2016.
</p>
<p>
    The 2016 version gained the following <em>major</em> improvements, amongst many other small improvements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Overhauled UI, abondoning Unity's legacy UI for their new system</li>
    <li>New level organization, grouping by difficulty, showing level previews and various stats</li>
    <li>Difficulties now have their own colour scheme, used as the background colour of levels</li>
    <li>Released the game on iOS</li>
    <li>Added support for Leaderboards and Achievements</li>
    <li>Added survival mode</li>
    <li>Added level replays which can be shared via Everyplay</li>
    <li>The first 50 levels are now free</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Notably the game features a very cool level editor tool which Matthew created.
	Levels are actually designed in Photoshop using a 64x64 image and only the colours black (obstacles), white (open space), green (moons), and blue (spawn point).
	The images are converted to text files in the Unity editor.
	The text files are loaded at runtime to generate levels on the fly, reducing the file size of the game.
	This allowed us to create over 100 levels in under a month.
	You can see a more in-depth look at the level creation process via <a href="https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/free-ios-android-orbert.433363/">this post I made on the Unity Forum</a>.

<p>
    Level previews are also automatically generated via an editor tool I created which loads each level and saves a screenshot of it.
</p>
<p>
    Orbert is a pretty cool little game and will hopefully be released on more platforms when I have time.
    A WebGL version is in the works which I plan to release on Kongregate.
    I may also create a tvOS version for Apple TV users, mostly for the learning experience.
